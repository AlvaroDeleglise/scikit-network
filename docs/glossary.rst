        Square matrix whose entries indicate edges between nodes of a graph, usually denoted by :math:`A`.

    biadjacency
        Rectangular matrix whose entries indicate edges between nodes of a bipartite graph,
        usually denoted by :math:`B`.

    co-neighbors
        Graph defined by :math:`\tilde{A} = AF^{-1}A^T`, or :math:`\tilde{B} = BF^{-1}B^T`,
        where :math:`F` is a weight matrix.
